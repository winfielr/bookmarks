<p>Welcome to the Adisham Bookmarks website.</p>
<p>We are a small, friendly group, mostly from Adisham in Kent. We meet at each
  other&#8217;s homes on the 2nd Friday of each month &amp; discuss a book chosen
  by one of our members. </p>
<p>We select books that interest us, that we have enjoyed or that we would like
  to read, but have never got around to. They range from modern to much older
  fiction, plays, classics, biography, autobiography, books about history &amp;
  current affairs. The person who chose the book asks a couple of questions they
  would like the group to consider before they read it. </p>
<p>The meeting starts at 8pm &amp; the host provides nibbles &amp; drinks (wine,
  beer &amp; soft drinks). Everyone gets a chance to answer the points raised,
  ask more questions &amp; add general comments about the books &#8211; we like
  to be informal &amp; we often end up discussing associated (and non-associated)
  topics too. </p>
<p>At the end each member scores the book out of 5 stars &amp; an average rating
  is given. A review is written &amp; the score posted on this website. The meeting
  normally finishes around 10 to 10:30pm, unless we get carried away.</p>
