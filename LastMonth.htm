    <td>This book probably does more than any other book to convey the comradeship,
      boredom, vices, unease and terror of war. <br>
      There is also a dark humour running through it - stories away from the front
      and regarding the work and systems the army operated at the time. The officer
      class is seen from a private's eyes - &amp; it seems a balanced portrayal.
      The book mirrors Manning&#8217;s war &amp; WWI seems to have left him dying
      slowly with eagerness only to finish this workThe only book written from
      a private&#8217;s point of view by a classics author<br>
      Armies make war, people die and this book brings them to life.<br></td>
    <td>The elements that made the book so shocking when it was released (the
      swearing &amp; accurate portrayal of officers), now seem normal &amp; this
      along with the more defined class system makes the book feel dated. <br>
      He also fails to give most of the soldiers any background or introduce them
      properly.<br>
      The central character seems to mix with the men &amp; the officers, but
      does not fit in with either. This seems an exceptional situation &amp; perhaps
      compromises how accurate the observed relationships are.<br>
      The author never really opens up.</td>
